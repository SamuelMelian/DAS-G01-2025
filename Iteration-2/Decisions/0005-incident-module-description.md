# Incident Module Description

* Status: proposed
* Deciders: Alejandro Garcia Prada
* Date: 2025-11-01

## Context and Problem Statement

The company needs to manage the incidents that are sent to the system admins. Examples of this incidents are not delivered products or a track fault. This module is located in the business logic tier, but we have to concrete it's inner composition

## Decision Drivers

* RF-09 Reportar incidencias

## Considered Options

* 0005-1-Factory-Pattern
* 0005-2-Builder-Pattern

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "0005-2-Builder-Pattern", because it provides a clearer and more flexible way to construct complex incident objects.

It is expected that incidents will evolve to include more parameters, optional fields, and conditional configurations, rather than an ever-growing number of incident types.

The Builder Pattern better supports this scenario, as it allows for progressive construction of objects without the need for multiple constructors or excessive subclassing.

### Positive Consequences

* The creation of incidents becomes more maintainable and extensible as new parameters or optional fields are added over time.
* It keeps the construction process modular and decoupled from the representation, improving flow readability and maintainability.
* It prevents the proliferation of multiple constructors or subclasses for each incident variant, reducing complexity in the long term.

### Negative Consequences

* It adds an extra abstraction layer, which can be unnecessary when incident creation is simple. A Factory Pattern would provide a more direct solution.
* It requires multiple steps to create an object, which increases verbosity.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### 0005-1-Factory Pattern

The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

Instead of instantiating classes directly (new), you delegate that responsibility to a factory that decides which class to instantiate depending on some logic.

In this concrete case, we would have a superclass that create the incidents and two subclasses for each incident type.

* Good, because it centralizes object creation logic.
* Good, because it supports the Open/Closed Principle (you can add new types without modifying the inner class).
* Good, because it decouple class that uses objects from the class that instantiates them.
* Bad, because it can lead to an increase in the number of classes (if incresing the type of incidents or related "products").
* Bad, because it For very simple creation logic, it can add unnecessary abstraction.

## 0005-2-Builder-Pattern

The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different types or configurations of objects.

Instead of passing all parameters to a constructor or relying on subclasses, the Builder provides step-by-step methods to configure and assemble an object. This makes object creation flexible, especially when many optional or conditional parameters are involved.

In this concrete case, we would have a builder class responsible for constructing incident objects. Each builder could configure incidents differently depending on the client type (eg: costumer or driver ), while following the same overall construction process.

* Good, because it separates the process of constructing an object from the way that object is represented.
* Good, because it makes the flow more readable and flexible, especially when the object being created has many optional or dependent parameters.
* Good, because it allows the same construction process to produce different representations or configurations of the object.
* Bad, because it introduces additional complexity and increases the number of classes, which can make the system heavier.
* Bad, because if not properly organized, it can lead to redundant or repetitive builder logic.
* Bad, because it provides little benefit for simple objects or cases where only a few parameters are needed.
